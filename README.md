🔍 Introducing the AI-Powered Resume Analyzer
I’m pleased to share a project I’ve recently developed — an intelligent Resume Analyzer that leverages Google’s Gemini 1.5 Flash model, built using a modern full-stack approach combining Flask, LangChain, and Streamlit.
📄 About the Project:
 This tool enables users to upload their resumes in PDF format and receive real-time, AI-driven analysis and actionable feedback. It aims to help job seekers enhance their resumes by identifying strengths, highlighting missing skills, and suggesting improvements — all in a matter of seconds.
🧠 Key Features:
Resume content extraction and segmentation using LangChain
AI-powered analysis using Gemini 1.5 Flash (Google Generative AI)
User-friendly frontend interface built with Streamlit
RESTful backend API powered by Flask
Seamless integration with PyPDF2 for PDF handling
